# Project---Predicting-Cognetive-States-of-Pilots-By-Analysing-Physiological-Data
## Overview

Most flight-related fatalities stem from a loss of “airplane state awareness.” That is, ineffective attention management on the part of pilots who may be distracted, sleepy or in other dangerous cognitive states.Our challenge is to build a model to detect troubling events from aircrew’s physiological data.
